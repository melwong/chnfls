Here's my script. The feedback that I'm looking for...
* Any honest feedback.
* Are the stakes high enough for the coach and team?
* Do you find the narration by Ethan (V.O) out of place or awkward (page 33 onwards)?
* Please IGNORE formatting issues cos I'll fix them later.

Appreciate your time and thoughts.

Hi toddles84. Could we share LinkedIn profiles? I'm a startup entrepreneur (2 exits) and I'm new in the screenwriting industry, thanks to COVID.

We can see this unsettles her. She turns away a bit, trying to contain herself.

mid 20’s, ELECTRONICS ENGINEER is working with her in the room. TECHIE, with glasses, passionate but impulsive.

It’s just a joke.



Title: UNTITLED THRILLER ROMANCE 
Logline: Theodore, a mentally troubled young man, falls in love with a beautiful young woman who calls herself Saoirse. Soon, their relationship spins out of control as Theodore embarks on a downward spiral.
Genre: Thriller, Drama, Romance
Pages: 80
Format: Feature
Feedback: I mainly want feedback on the story and characters, is it engaging to read? I will most likely be directing this in November/December so I don't really want feedback on the format of the screenplay.
Trade: Yes


I think I've misjudged you after reading your romance thriller. Why?

-You don't practice what you preach and your feedback for my script seems rather academic and by the book. If someone could read a book and follow all its rules to produce a award-winning movie, then everyone will be Oscars champion in art. Art doesn't work that way.
-After 20 pages, I still don't know where your story is going. No inciting incident. Mine starts around page 20.
-Your characters do SOUND the same, especially your mains. Actually, if you read my script thoroughly, the characters do talk differently as I make them do so, except extras. Check out Miles Manson dialogues.
-There's ZERO description about your characters not even age or height. So its hard to read and imagine how they even look like. Tarantino said scripts are to be READ, thus you should describe in more details to give readers more insights of the characters.
-If you watch enough movies, sometimes exposition is ok. Otherwise, the movie will be 4 hours long!
-Your script/story is overly simple and mundane to the extend that it's extremely dull. It's hard to want to turn the page at all, making read it a painful experience. The dialogue is dull and unentertaining. Sorkin said Shakespeare's plays don't sound like they are conversing in everyday language do they?

Now, I'm not intending to lash back at you but just to offer an honest feedback on your script and your feedback on my script.

Good luck buddy!
